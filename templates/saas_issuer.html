        <h1>Welcome to the issuer configurator and generator.</h1>
        <h3 class="mt-5">What you need to do is to install in your code a webhook and a callback endpoint and redirect your user to a QR code page.
      
        <h3 class="mt-5">How it works ?</h3> 
        <br>When you want the user to collect her credential you redirect her browser to the issuer page provided by the platform so she can scan a QR code (or activate a deeplink).
        <br>Then your application receives a call on its webhook endpoint with eventually the requested credential of your choice in the form of a json.
        <br>Your application sends back either the data to include in a credential or the signed credential to transfer to the wallet.
        <br>If needed the platform signs the credential and transfers it to the user's wallet. 
        <br>If the transfer is successful the user is redirected to your application callback endpoint.
        <br>Most of the parameters (DID method, keys, credentials, page design,...) can be configured on the platform in a couple of minutes.

        <br><br>An example of a minimal application (python) using this platform is <a href= "https://github.com/TalaoDAO/sandbox/blob/master/issuer_app_diploma.py ">here</a>.
