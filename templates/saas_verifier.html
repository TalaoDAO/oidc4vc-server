        <h1>Welcome to the verifier configurator and generator.</h1>
        <br><br>
        <h3>You can add a verifier to your code as a login similar to Facebook or Google Connect (or FranceConnect).</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>What you need to do is to install in your code a client OpenID library.
        <br>It takes no more than 2 hours.</h3>
        <br>
        A list of libraries available for different platforms is <a href="https://openid.net/developers/certified/">here</a>.
        
        <br><br><br>
        <h3>How it works ?</h3>
        <br>For each user for whom you want to obtain verifiable credentials or authenticate with credentials, your applications requests OpenID authentication.
        <br>The platform will manage a user redirect to a page with a QR code (or deep link for mobile browser) allowing users to present a verifiable credential-presentation stored in their wallet.
        <br>Your app will receive the user credential as a json file on the userinfo endpoint.
        <br>The verification of the signatures of the issuer and the user's wallet is carried out by the platform, your application can simply access the attributes of the json received in complete safety.
        <br>You can now update or generate different verifiers for your needs. The code of this platform is open source. 
        
        <br><br>An example of a minimal python application using this platform is <a href= "https://github.com/TalaoDAO/sandbox/blob/master/verifier_app.py ">here</a>.
